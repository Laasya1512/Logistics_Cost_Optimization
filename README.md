## Data

The project uses a dataset from 'Comparison_Data - Sheet1.csv' to analyze and visualize transportation data. This dataset includes information related to railways, roads, and coastal routes, including characteristics, capacity, and energy consumption.

## Data Visualization

The project includes various data visualization techniques to provide insights into transportation modes:

1. *Line Plot*: A line plot compares the characteristics of different transportation modes based on specific indices. This visualization helps in understanding the relative strengths of each mode.

2. *Histograms*: Histograms display the distribution of data for each transportation mode. This allows for a deeper exploration of data patterns and variations.

3. *Pie Charts*: Pie charts represent the distribution of capacity and energy consumption among transportation modes. These charts offer a clear overview of the proportions of capacity and energy usage for each mode.

## Usage

To run the project and generate the visualizations, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib, if not already installed.
3. Download the dataset 'Comparison_Data - Sheet1.csv' and place it in the project directory.
4. Run the Python script to generate the visualizations.

Example command to run the script:
bash
python transportation_visualization.py
